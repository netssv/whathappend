# WhatHappened ️‍️

**The terminal you always wanted in your browser side panel.**

Ever find yourself jumping between 10 different tabs just to check a DNS record, see why an SSL certificate is acting up, or figure out who is actually hosting a site? We were tired of that too. So we built **WhatHappened**.

It’s a simple, powerful terminal that lives right in your Chrome side panel. It tells you exactly what’s going on under the hood of any website you’re visiting—without the clutter, without the tracking, and without the headaches.

## Why you'll love it

- **Context Aware**: Open the side panel, and it already knows what domain you're looking at. Just hit Enter to start a quick audit.
- **Human-Friendly**: We don't just dump raw data. We translate complex infrastructure into plain English so you actually understand the results.
- **Privacy First**: Everything runs locally in your browser. No servers, no databases, no tracking. Your data stays yours.
- **Real-Time Data**: We don't use stale static databases. We query live infrastructure (DNS, RDAP) in real-time to give you the most accurate "ground truth."

## Quick Start 

The fastest way to get an answer is to open the side panel and:

1. **Press Enter** — The terminal automatically detects the site you're on and runs a quick check on the Registrar, NameServers, and Web Host.
2. **Type `go`** — Same as above, but for when you want to be explicit.
3. **Type `google.com`** — To set a new target. It will load the header info silently in the background while you keep working.

### Try these commands:
```text
 email google.com # Is their email security (SPF, DMARC, DKIM) set up right?
 sec github.com # Check SSL health and those pesky security headers.
 seo example.com # Run a baseline SEO audit (Title, Meta, H1).
 hosting example.com # Who is actually running this site?
 vitals # How's the performance? (LCP, CLS, INP)
 help # See the full list of what you can do.
```

## What’s New in v2.5.0? 

We’ve been busy making the terminal smarter and easier to use:

- **Tab Superpowers**: Manage and diagnose your open tabs directly from the terminal with the new `tabs` commands.
- **Hard Reboot**: Use `reload` to quickly flush memory and restart the extension context.
- **Silent Mode**: Setting a target is now "silent." It populates the top header quietly in the background, keeping the terminal clean for your next command.
- **Command Chaining**: Save time by running a command at the same time you set a target. Try `google.com -vitals` or `example.com -whois`.
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Press `Tab` after typing a domain to see available flags, or use it to quickly fill in domains from your other open tabs!
- **Dual-Mode `ip`**: Check your own public IP or resolve any domain's A record and provider in one go.
- **Notes**: Annotate your findings as you go. They’ll even be included if you export your session to JSON.

## Our Privacy Promise ️

We take your privacy seriously because we’re users too.

- **Zero Cloud**: We don't have a backend. Your browser does 100% of the work.
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: We use standard public infrastructure like Google's DNS or the RDAP registry. We never send your cookies or identifying data to them.
- **Bundled & Secure**: We don't load scripts from CDNs. Everything is self-contained inside the extension for maximum security.

## Under the Hood ️

WhatHappened is a strict **Manifest V3** extension built for performance and reliability:
- **xterm.js**: For that authentic, high-performance terminal feel.
- **Atomic Architecture**: Our modules are strictly organized and kept under 200 lines to ensure the code stays fast and bug-free.
- **Heuristic Engine**: We don't rely on hardcoded "provider lists." We analyze live CNAME chains and IP data to figure out infrastructure on the fly.
